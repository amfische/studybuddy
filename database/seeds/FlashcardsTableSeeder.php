1. The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. 

2. Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function\'s variablesâ€”scope chain even after the outer function has returned.

When a property is accessed on an object and if the property is not found on that object, the JavaScript engine looks at the object\'s prototype, and the prototype\'s prototype and so on, until it finds the property defined on one of the prototypes or until it reaches the end of the prototype chain. This behavior simulates classical inheritance, but it is really more of delegation than inheritance.'

						Better interactivity. New content from the server can be changed dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.
						Reduce connections to the server since scripts and stylesheets only have to be requested once.
						State can be maintained on a page. JavaScript variables and DOM state will persist because the main container page was not reloaded.
						Basically most of the advantages of an SPA.
						Disadvantages

						Dynamic webpages are harder to bookmark.
						Does not work if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.
						Some webcrawlers do not execute JavaScript and would not see content that has been loaded by JavaScript.
						Basically most of the disadvantages of an SPA.'
